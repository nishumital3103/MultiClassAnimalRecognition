## Problem Statement:  

Multi-Class Animal Recognition for Wildlife Conservation

Wildlife Monitoring Need: Difficulty in manually tracking and identifying animals in their natural habitat for research and conservation.

Surveillance Extension: Requirement for automated systems that support wildlife surveillance and ensure minimal human intervention.

Multi-Class Categorization Challenge: Need for an intelligent model capable of accurately classifying 90 different animal species for detailed analysis.

## Solution:  

MobileNetV2 (Pretrained): Utilized MobileNetV2 for its lightweight architecture and strong performance in image recognition tasks.

90-Class Softmax Layer: Integrated a Softmax layer to enable classification across 90 distinct animal categories.

Efficient Animal Recognition: Enabled accurate and efficient recognition of multiple animal species using deep learning.

Optimized for Mobile Resources: Designed the solution to be deployable on mobile and edge devices for real-time, resource-efficient use.

Scalable and Real-World Ready: The model architecture is scalable and can be extended to more classes, making it suitable for real-world applications like wildlife monitoring and smart surveillance systems.
